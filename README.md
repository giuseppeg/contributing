# Contributing

This document describes my personal Open Source Contributor Manifesto and Policies. 

I have a full time job and work on side projects and Open Source Software at random times and most of the times just for fun.

Unfortunately, as [@Kitze](https://twitter.com/thekitze) wrote 

<a href="https://medium.com/@kitze/github-stars-wont-pay-your-rent-8b348e12baed" target="_blank"><img alt="Blog Post: Stars Won't Pay You Rent" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/stars-won't%20pay%20you%20rent-ff0000"></a>

Since most of my contributions are to side projects and I don't want to burn out, in some cases I might decide to disable GitHub issues or turn off notifications for the most active projects. 

Don't worry though, periodically I take a look at open issues and PRs and take action if necessary!

If you want to support my free work or get dedicated attention and support with any of the projects I contribute to, please don't hesitate to check out my [sponsorship page](https://github.com/users/giuseppeg/sponsorship) on GitHub.

### Bugs

If you find a bug in [one of the projects I maintain](https://github.com/giuseppeg/repositories), please submit a pull request with a failing test or a fix, and good description for the issue.

When issues are enabled, please always include a testcase in the form of a minimal repository or link to a live playground (my favorite is [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io)). 

From my experience, issues with a clear description and a testcase are fixed or resolved much faster than others!

### Features request

Please submit a pull request with an RFC where you explain the why and the how you think this feature is useful. I'd be glad to start a conversation from there before moving on to implementation. Also please let me know if you would be up to implement the feature you are suggesting.
